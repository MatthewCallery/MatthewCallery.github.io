            We're tired of hearing that tech is going to kill the recruitment
            industry. It's a vital part of the job market and we want to restore
            its image with your help.
            <br/><br/>
            Our aim is to bring transparency to the sector, so that employers
            can easily identify professional headhunters and avoid those who
            employ the aggressive sales tactics that give recruitment a bad
            reputation.
